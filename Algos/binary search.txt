// Write a binary search function that, given a sorted array and a number, will 
// return whether the number exists in the array. 

// The idea of binary search is you start at the middle, check to see if the number
// given is equal to, greater than, or less than the element in the middle, and do
// one of the following:
// 1. If the element we're looking at is EQUAL to the number requested, return true
// 2. If the element we're looking at is GREATER than the number requested, find 
//    the element in the middle of the LEFT side of the current element and do the
//    same check again. 
// 3. If the element we're looking at is LESS than the number requested, find 
//    the element in the middle of the RIGHT side of the current element and do the
//    same check again. 

// EXAMPLE: binarySearch([1,3,4,5,6], 2) --> false, because 2 is not in the array
function binarySearch(array, num){
